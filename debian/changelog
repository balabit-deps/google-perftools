google-perftools (0.98-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #425147)
  * Compiled with GCC 4.3. (Closes: #454841)
  * debian/watch: can now report upstream's version (Closes: #450294)
  * Because of a file conflict between tau and libgoogle-perftools the
    binary pprof is renamed as google-pprof. (Closes: #404001)
    Great thanks to Michael Mende.
  * debian/rules: autoconf files are now generated at the build time.
  * Bumped up Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no changes are required.
  * Split a new package, libtcmallc_minimal0. The upstream supports
    this module for wider platforms. So I leave its architecture to be
    `any'.
  * libgoogle-perftools0's architecture is now i386. The upstream
    supports this module for x86 and x86_64. However, x86_64 requires
    libunwind's development head, which Debian does not have yet.
  * Removed an unnecessary patch, debian/patches/02_profiler.cc_alpha.diff.
